        <h1>Hej!</h1>
        <p>
            UX designer from Barcelona, based in Malm√∂. My latest achievements have been to receive a diploma from the UX design institute. Throughout my course and previous work as a graphic designer, I always put the end-user first, while following a methodical process to build and deliver the best solution.

        <p>
            By day, I am constantly self-learning and developing skills in UX design to improve and deliver the best user experience.

            In my free time, I like losing myself in an art museum, book store or a coffee shop.
