For this project I had to design the brochure report for the OECS.
### Briefing
Design a technical brochure report that followed  a tropical theme.

### Goal
Establish a consistent style that didn't add too much visual noise to the content.
### Challenge
The client wanted to include many visual elements, but they had to be balanced with the content.
