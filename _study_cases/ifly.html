            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The simplest part of planning a trip is deciding the destination. 
                But booking a flight through a mobile app can be a complex experience. 
                Through this case study I propose a booking flow with a friction free experience. </p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
                This case study was my graduation project for the UX design institute. 
                Throughout this project I performed both the research and design process in order to 
                achieve the professional diploma. </p>

                <h3>The problem</h3>
                <p>
                    During the booking process on an airlineâ€™s mobile app, the user is required to complete a set of tasks in order to successfully book a flight.

                <h3>Challenge</h3>
                <p>
                    The challenge is to develop a friction-free and smooth booking process.   
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="list-paragragh">
                <h3>Goal</h3>
                <p>
                    The goal is through this solution to keep the user feeling confident while using the app.

                <h3>Constrain</h3>
                <p>
                    The constraint is to improve the flow but also maintain existing flight booking conventions

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                The first step in the process is to analyse how competitors are solving the booking process.  I focused on three European airlines, two of which were short haul carriers and the other was a long haul carrier. I also analysed AirBnB as a travel related competitor. 
               </p>
               <h5>Why did I use this methodology?</h5>
               <p>To understand the established industry conventions for this complex flow. </p>
               <p>To check what the competitions are currently offering to their users.</p>
               <p>Identify the best practices that I can adopt and what to avoid in order to offer the best user experience.</p>
               <h5>Findings</h5>
                <dl>
                    <dd>
                        Booking a flight is a highly structured process, where the user steps through a series of screens.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Throughout these steps, the user is required to complete specific tasks such as selecting dates and filling out passenger forms. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>Across the airline industry there is a well defined process for booking flights, so breaking that convention could backfire.
