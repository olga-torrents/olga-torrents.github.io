            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The simplest part of planning a trip is deciding the destination. 
                But booking a flight through a mobile app can be a complex experience. 
                Through this case study I propose a booking flow with a friction free experience.

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
                This case study was my graduation project for the UX design institute. 
                Throughout this project I performed both the research and design process in order to 
                achieve the professional diploma.

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                The first step in the process is to analyse how competitors are solving the booking process.  I focused on three European airlines, two of which were short haul carriers and the other was a long haul carrier. I also analysed AirBnB as a travel related competitor. 
               </p>
               <h5>Why did I use this methodology?</h5>
               <p>To understand the established industry conventions for this complex flow. </p>
               <p>To check what the competitors are currently offering to their users.</p>
               <p>Identify the best practices that I can adopt and what to avoid in order to offer the best user experience.</p>
               <h5>Findings</h5>
                <dl>
                    <dd>
                        Booking a flight is a highly structured process, where the user steps through a series of screens.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Throughout these steps, the user is required to complete specific tasks such as selecting dates and filling out passenger forms. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>Across the airline industry there is a well defined process for booking flights, so breaking that convention could backfire.

               <p>
                    In order to acquire more data about the project, I ran an online survey. Using both closed-ended and open-ended questions I was able to collect useful data about user behaviour.

               <h5>Why did I use this methodology?</h5>
               <p>This methodology is an easy and cheap way to gather quantitative and qualitative data about the users. </p>

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                During this phase, I reviewed two usability test recordings that were provided by the UX Institute. Each recording was of a user 
                performing the task of booking a flight in both the Aer Lingus and Eurowings apps. The test began with an in-depth interview to give the user context. Throughout the interviews I took detailed notes about the user’s goals, behaviour, pain points and mental models.
                </p>
               <h5>Why did I use this methodology?</h5>
               <p>
                Learn to identify the user’s goals, behaviours, pain points and mental models throughout the flow.
               </p>
               <p>
                Understand the importance of the user’s context in order to assess the entire usability test.

               <h5>Findings</h5>
                <dl>

                        Price and flight times are the main search criteria for users.

                    <dd>
                        On the home screen of the apps, the intrusive advertising distracts the users from their goal of booking a flight.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Extra steps not well highlighted when selecting the breakdown of different fares. This breaks the user’s mental models of the flow.

                </dl>
                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>
                    The selection of both the flight and the type of fare is a major pain point for the user.

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                The next logical step was to perform a usability test. To achieve this, I recruited a friend who travels by air on a regular basis and books their flight online. I conducted the test remotely.
               </p>
               <p>
                Since I did not have an existing product but was researching for a new one, I decided to use two existing competitor apps instead. They were SAS and Norwegian apps. I prepared an in depth interview and test to be completed within one hour.
               </p>
               <p>
                   <b>Tasks to complete:</b>
               </p>
               <p>
                Book a flight for a City break. Fly from Copenhagen to Paris from November 9th to 11th but flexible with departure dates. The trip is for two people. The flow stops before the seat selection.
               </p>
               <h5>Why I choose this methodology?</h5>
               <p>
                Whereas before I was given two video recordings to take notes on. This time I prepared the material for a comparative interview and then conducted it with the participant.
               </p>
               <p>
                This is arguably one the best ways to gain deep insights about user behaviour. 
               </p>
               <h5>Findings</h5>
                <dl>
                    <dd>
                        The SAS interface was less cluttered and that prevented the flow from being interrupted
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        In the Norwegian app test, it was more challenging for the user to book a flight. There was confusion on selecting the flight and the fares, which were not clear. The user was getting lost at different points in the flow.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>
                    The user had never used the SAS or Norwegian app before. But they still knew how to navigate through them. This confirms that industry conventions are well known.

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                The Affinity diagram was the best tool to group the data and draw conclusions from it as we reviewed the data.
               </p>
               <p>
                As we move forward with the process of organizing the data, we were able to learn facts and findings from the data.
               </p>
               <p>
                As it was a collaborative process, it was very rewarding working with someone and focusing on a single task. It also had the benefit that I could have a different perspective of the data.
               </p>

                    <dd>
                        The SAS interface was less cluttered and that prevented the flow from being interrupted
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        The main goal of the Home screen is to start the flight search. was confusion on selecting the flight and the fares, which were not clear. The user was getting lost at different points in the flow.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Most users carry out this process from home.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Users get confused when navigating between the departure and return screens.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        It is important to inform if the selected flight is direct or has a layover.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Selecting fares is confusing and the Compare Fares screen has too much information
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Being able to add flight extras is a good feature.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Giving constant feedback helps users to stay in the flow.

                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>
                    I found that this step allowed me to review all the data I collected and really analyse it in depth. Working with someone else, we were able to take the unstructured data and clustered it together into a structured and then we were able to identify logical patterns.

                The purpose of the customer journey diagram was to continue shaping and structuring the data previously obtained, and to create a visualisation. To achieve this, I put myself in the mind of the user and attributed their positive and negative points to each steps of the flow

                <p>
                    From the customer journey diagram I now know the key user goals and more importantly the common pain points and mental models that prevent the user from having a smooth booking experience. They are:
                </p>
                <dl>
                    <dd>

                    <dd>
                        Unclear information about whether the flight is direct or not.

                    Going through this process allowed me to understand that a user’s experience depends on their goals. These goals are not always global and each step can have it’s own mini goals. The mini goals can either improve or disimprove the user’s experience.

                The objective of this phase was to create a high level flow of the booking process. For this project, my main focus was on one primary use case. To achieve this I split the flow into more detailed tasks.

            <h5>Why I choose this methodology?</h5>
            <p>
                For me, this process helped me to identify the main and sub screens. It also informed me which screen the content will go on.

                    This step allowed me to further organize the data I collected and I was able to start designing a more concrete architecture for the booking process.

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                At this point I began to develop a solution to the problem. This involved creating sketches of the screens that would form part of my solution. To achieve the initial design I followed the methodology below:
               </p>
               <ol>
                   <li>
                    Using the flow diagram I identified the key screens I needed to design.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    Create a list of key features for each screen.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    I focused on a single screen, where I put the user goal first. Then I took the feature list and sorted it by priority to achieve that goal. With these criteria  I made several variations that tried to solve this problem.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    I reviewed each of these variations and I selected the one that best satisfies the user goal. And making sure that I included all the key features.
                   </li>
                   <li>
                    Once I identified the best sketch for each screen. I brought the sketches together to validate that the solution satisfies the user’s end goal of booking a flight. 
                   </li>
               </ol>
               <h5>Methodology</h5>
               <p>
                   With my affinity diagram I boradly know the architecture of the booking process, but now I needed to start solving the problem that users were experiencing. This process is to do a rapid prototype and to experiment with different ideas and concepts.
               </p>
                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>
                    Through this quick and iterative process I was able to move to the next stage with a design that solves the needs of the user. I was also able to identify potential issues to be aware of when designing on the computer.

                    With the sketches I was able to begin creating an interactive prototype of my solution. This medium fidelity prototype focused on taking the sketches I created and making a realistic and intuitive prototype. Where you can see how the end to end booking process worked. At this point I didn’t focus on the theming or branding of the app, since I wanted to focus on building recognizable UI elements with different states.

                    This was the final project for my UX course. The focus here was to create a wireframe that provided detailed information to the software engineers and other stakeholders on how to build this solution. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since this was the last project I had to do for the course. In it I included extra information, such as the states of the buttons and form, as well as font and color systems

                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>
                    To develop this wireframe I had to go through the entire flow. It was useful to reflect on the work and see how it could be further improved.

                    As an extra step I decided to create a more realistic prototype. My focus was to improve the look and feel of the prototype as well as include small animations.

                <p>
                    I wished to follow the iterative process of continuously refining the design. By also including some branding I was able to bring the design to life.
