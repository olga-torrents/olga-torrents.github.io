            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>
                The simplest part of planning a trip is deciding the destination. 
                But booking a flight through a mobile app can be a complex experience. 
                Through this case study I propose a booking flow with a friction free experience.

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
                This case study was my graduation project for the UX design institute. 
                Throughout this project I performed both the research and design process in order to 
                achieve the professional diploma.

                <p>
                    During the booking process on an airlineâ€™s mobile app, the user is required to complete a set of tasks in order to successfully book a flight.

                    Understanding industry conventions and develop a smooth friction-free booking process.

                    To keep the user feeling confident throughout the whole booking process.

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                The first step in the process is to analyse how competitors are solving the booking process.  I focused on three European airlines, two of which were short haul carriers and the other was a long haul carrier. I also analysed AirBnB as a travel related competitor. 
               </p>
               <h5>Why did I use this methodology?</h5>
               <p>To understand the established industry conventions for this complex flow. </p>
               <p>To check what the competitors are currently offering to their users.</p>
               <p>Identify the best practices that I can adopt and what to avoid in order to offer the best user experience.</p>
               <h5>Findings</h5>
                <dl>
                    <dd>
                        Booking a flight is a highly structured process, where the user steps through a series of screens.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Throughout these steps, the user is required to complete specific tasks such as selecting dates and filling out passenger forms. 
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>Across the airline industry there is a well defined process for booking flights, so breaking that convention could backfire.

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                    In order to acquire more data about the project, I ran an online survey. Using both closed-ended and open-ended questions I was able to collect useful data about user behaviour.
                </p>
               <h5>Why did I use this methodology?</h5>
               <p>This methodology is an easy and cheap way to gather quantitative and qualitative data about the users. </p>
               <h5>Findings</h5>
                <dl>
                    <dd>
                        Users prefer searching for flights on airline websites. 
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Mobile apps are typically used for checking-in.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Most users make short-distance trips.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Users associate their travel experience with the in app experience.

                </dl>
                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>
                    This process has helped me gain insight into how users use these types of apps.

               <h5>About</h5>
               <p>
                During this phase, I reviewed two usability test recordings that were provided by the UX Institute. Each recording was of a user 
                performing the task of booking a flight in both the Aer Lingus and Eurowings apps. The test began with an in-depth interview to give the user context. Throughout the interviews I took detailed notes about the userâ€™s goals, behaviour, pain points and mental models.
                </p>
               <h5>Why did I use this methodology?</h5>
               <p>
                Learn to identify the userâ€™s goals, behaviours, pain points and mental models throughout the flow.
               </p>
               <p>
                Understand the importance of the userâ€™s context in order to assess the entire usability test.  
               </p>
               <h5>Findings</h5>
                <dl>
                    <dd>
                        Price and flight times are the main search criteria for users.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        On the home screen of the apps, the intrusive advertising distracts the users from their goal of booking a flight.
                    </dd>
                    <dd>
                        Extra steps not well highlighted when selecting the breakdown of different fares. This breaks the userâ€™s mental models of the flow.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <h5>Hypothesis</h5>
                <p>
                    The selection of both the flight and the type of fare is a major pain point for the user.
